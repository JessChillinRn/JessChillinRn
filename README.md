<h4>- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jess and I'm just chillin :) </h4><br>
<br>
I'm honestly just learning any type of code I can right now along with <br>
my digital design classes, and my graphic design class at school.<br>
next year I'll also be taking AP computer science (I can't take it until I'm a sophomore) <br>
I'm starting an insta soon to post my progress and just as a creative outlet too, so you'll <br>
be able to contact me from there too. ;)
